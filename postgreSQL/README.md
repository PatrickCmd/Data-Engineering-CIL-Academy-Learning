### ACID compliance

**Atomicity**: Store data in an all-or-nothing approach.
**Consistency**: Give me a consistent picture of the data.
**Isolation**: Prevent concurrent data updates from incorrect reads/writes.
**Durability**: When I say `COMMIT`; the data, make sure it is safe until I explicitly destroy it.

### Database transactions
- A transaction is a unit of work.
- A transaction is all or nothing:
    - Beginning (BEGIN;)
    - Work (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT)
    - Ending (END;) results in one of  the following:
        - COMMIT; (save everything)
        - ROLLBACK; (undo all changes, and save nothing)
- Once the transaction ends, it either makes ALL of the changes between BEGIN; and COMMIT; or NONE of them (if there is an error, for example).

### PostgreSQL features
