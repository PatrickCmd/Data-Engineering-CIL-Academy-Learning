## I AM Roles

### Steps to create an IAM role for an AWS EC2 instance using S3 for storage and DynamoDB as the database

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the IAM console.

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select "Roles," then click the "Create Role" button.

3. Select "AWS service" as the type of trusted entity and choose "EC2" from the list of services.

4. On the "Permissions" page, select "AmazonS3FullAccess" and "AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess" from the list of policies to attach to the role.

5. Give the role a name and description that will help you remember its purpose.

6. Review the details of the role, and then click "Create Role" to create the new IAM role.

7. Once the role is created, you will see a page that displays the role's ARN (Amazon Resource Name). Make a note of this ARN, as you will need it to attach the role to your EC2 instance.

8. Navigate to the EC2 console and select the instance for which you want to create the IAM role.

9. In the "Actions" dropdown, select "Instance Settings" and then "Attach/Replace IAM Role."

10. In the "Attach IAM Role" dialog box, select the IAM role you just created from the dropdown list, and then click "Apply."

11. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate, and then your EC2 instance will have the necessary permissions to access S3 and DynamoDB.

#### Trusted Entities

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "ec2.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation of policy

- The AWS policy you provided is a JSON-formatted policy document written in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language. 

- The policy document allows the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service to assume a specified AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which has permissions to perform certain actions within the AWS environment. 

- Specifically, the policy statement grants permission to the EC2 service to assume the role via the "sts:AssumeRole" action. The principal that is granted this permission is the EC2 service itself, which is identified by the "ec2.amazonaws.com" service principal. 

- The **"Effect"** attribute specifies the effect of the policy statement, which in this case is "Allow". 

- Overall, this policy statement allows EC2 instances to assume an IAM role with the specified permissions, enabling them to perform certain actions in the AWS environment based on the policies attached to that IAM role.

#### AmazonS3FullAccess

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "s3-object-lambda:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Explanation of policy

- The AWS policy you provided is a JSON-formatted policy document written in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language. 

- The policy document grants full permissions to perform any S3 actions (using the "s3:*" wildcard) and any S3 Object Lambda actions (using the "s3-object-lambda:*" wildcard). 

- The "Effect" attribute specifies the effect of the policy statement, which in this case is "Allow". 

- The "Resource" attribute specifies the resource or resources to which the permissions apply. In this policy, the wildcard "*" is used to indicate that the permissions apply to any resource in the AWS account. 

- Overall, this policy statement grants full access to all S3 and S3 Object Lambda actions to the entity or user to which the policy is attached. It is important to note that granting such broad permissions is not recommended, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities in your AWS environment. It is recommended to grant only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform specific actions or tasks.

Explanation of policy

This AWS policy document is a JSON-formatted IAM policy that grants a variety of permissions to perform actions on various AWS services. 

- The first "Statement" section lists the AWS services and actions that are allowed for the principal (user, group, or role) to which the policy is attached. It allows all actions on the DynamoDB, DAX, CloudWatch, Data Pipeline, EC2, IAM, KMS, SNS, Lambda, Resource Groups, Tagging, Kinesis, and Application Auto Scaling services. The "Resource" attribute is set to "*" to allow all resources of those services. 

- The second "Statement" section allows access to get insight rule reports for the DynamoDB Contributor Insights resource. The "Resource" attribute restricts the action to only resources with an ARN that matches the provided pattern.

- The third "Statement" section allows the IAM "PassRole" action, which allows a principal to pass a role to a service. This section specifies that the "iam:PassedToService" condition must match one of the specified services, which are the Application Auto Scaling and DAX services.

- The fourth and final "Statement" section allows the IAM "CreateServiceLinkedRole" action, which is used to create roles that can be assumed by AWS services. This section specifies that the "iam:AWSServiceName" condition must match one of the specified services, which are DynamoDB Replication, DAX, DynamoDB Application Auto Scaling, Contributor Insights, and Kinesis Replication.

- Overall, this policy provides a wide range of permissions to perform actions on several AWS services, which could be useful in certain scenarios. However, it is important to note that granting such broad permissions is not recommended, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities in your AWS environment. It is recommended to grant only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform specific actions or tasks.

## Creating VPC with subnets


To create a VPC in the US-East-1 region with a CIDR block of 10.1.0.0/16 and four subnets in two availability zones, two public and two private, and attach an internet gateway, you can follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC dashboard.

2. Click on the "Create VPC" button and enter the following details:
   - Name tag: Give a name tag to the VPC (e.g., my-vpc)
   - IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.0.0/16

3. Click on "Create" to create the VPC.

4. Next, create two subnets in each availability zone:
   - Navigate to the "Subnets" section in the VPC dashboard.
   - Click on "Create subnet" button.
   - For the first subnet:
     - Name tag: Give a name tag to the subnet (e.g., public-subnet-1a)
     - VPC: Select the VPC you just created.
     - Availability Zone: Select the first availability zone (e.g., us-east-1a).
     - IPv4 CIDR block: 10.1.1.0/24
     - Select "Yes" for "Auto-assign IPv4 address"
     - Click on "Create" to create the subnet.
   - Repeat the above steps to create the second subnet in the same availability zone with the name tag of (e.g., private-subnet-1a) and CIDR block 10.1.2.0/24.
   - Repeat the above steps for the second availability zone (e.g., us-east-1b) to create two subnets with the name tags of public-subnet-1b and private-subnet-1b, and CIDR blocks of 10.1.3.0/24 and 10.1.4.0/24, respectively.

5. Next, create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC:
   - Navigate to the "Internet Gateways" section in the VPC dashboard.
   - Click on "Create Internet Gateway" button.
   - Give a name tag to the Internet Gateway (e.g., my-igw)
   - Click on "Create" to create the Internet Gateway.
   - Select the Internet Gateway that you just created and click on "Attach to VPC" button.
   - Select the VPC you created in step 2 and click on "Attach" to attach the Internet Gateway to the VPC.

6. Finally, configure the route tables for the subnets:
   - Navigate to the "Route Tables" section in the VPC dashboard.
   - Select the route table for the public subnets in the first availability zone (e.g., public-subnet-1a).
   - Click on the "Routes" tab and then click on "Edit routes".
   - Add a new route with the following details:
     - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
     - Target: Select the Internet Gateway you attached in step 5.
     - Click on "Save routes" to save the route.
   - Repeat the above steps for the public subnets in the second availability zone (e.g., public-subnet-1b).

   - For the private subnets, select the route table for the private subnets in the first availability zone (e.g., private-subnet-1a).
   - Click on the "Routes" tab and then click on "Edit routes".
   - Add a new route with the following details:
     - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
