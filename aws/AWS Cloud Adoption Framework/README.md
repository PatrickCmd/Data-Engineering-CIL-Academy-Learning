# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework(CAF) Overview
The **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)** is designed to help you build and implement a comprehensive plan for your digital transformation that takes advantage of AWS best practices and lessons learned from thousands of customer engagements. 

The AWS CAF will help you do the following:

- Identify and prioritize transformation opportunities. 
- Evaluate and improve your cloud readiness. 
- Iteratively evolve the roadmap that you follow to guide your digital business transformation journey.

### The importance of the AWS CAF

A wide range of organizations see the potential in adopting cloud services, but adoption alone does not guarantee success. The AWS CAF takes advantage of AWS experience and best practices to help you digitally transform and accelerate business outcomes through innovative use of AWS products and services. 

This course will teach you the following:

- The value of a structured cloud adoption approach
- Risks to cloud adoption and implementation
- Use and benefits of the AWS CAF
- How to interpret the core elements of the AWS CAF
- Next steps to implement the AWS CAF

A recent estimate from McKinsey sizes the opportunity presented by the cloud across all businesses:

### What can go wrong

We all have access to tools and services to migrate workloads to the cloud. In most cases, this can be achieved with minimal human intervention. However, without a cloud transformation plan, merely moving workloads from point A to point B might not provide all the benefits of moving to the cloud. 

- **Pilot Stall**: Although organizations might have successfully implemented some pilot cloud initiatives, they might not have been able to demonstrate sufficient value. This might stall cloud adoption momentum because leaders might not be able to develop convincing business cases to scale the use of the cloud. 

- **Cloud Gridlock**: Cloud initiatives become stuck in long queues because of overly cumbersome governance processes, or the lack of automation, blueprints, and guardrails that are required to use cloud in a secure, scalable, and reliable manner. 

- **Unrealized Benefits**: Although the organization might have migrated a substantial portion of its technology estate to the cloud, any value realized might be limited. For example, if organizations treat cloud as another data center, without sufficiently taking advantage of automation and optimization, they might not be able to significantly reduce costs or increase organizational agility. 

- **Cloud Chaos**: If leadership does not have a shared vision and does not provide sufficient guidance and oversight, different parts of the organization might adopt cloud in different ways. This might lead to a proliferation in approaches and tooling, with potential implications for security, resiliency, cost, and compliance risks.

### AWS CAF components

The AWS CAF comprises several components including Business Outcomes, Transformation Domains, Perspectives, Foundational Capabilities, and Cloud Transformation Phases.

To learn more about some of these capabilities, expand the following three categories.

- **Security Governance**

Develop, maintain, and effectively communicate security roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, policies, processes, and procedures.

Ensuring clear lines of accountability is critical to the effectiveness of your security program. Understanding your assets, security risks, and compliance requirements that apply to your industry and organization will help you prioritize your security efforts. Providing ongoing direction and advice will help accelerate your transformation by allowing your teams to move faster.

Understand your responsibility for security in the cloud. Inventory, categorize, and prioritize relevant stakeholders, assets, and information exchanges. Identify laws, rules, regulations, and standards/frameworks that apply to your industry and organization. Perform an annual risk assessment on your organization. Risk assessments can assist in determining the likelihood and impact of identified risks and vulnerabilities that affect your organization. Allocate sufficient resources to identified security roles and responsibilities. Develop security policies, processes, procedures, and controls in line with your compliance requirements and organizational risk tolerance; continuously update based on evolving risks and requirements.

- **Vulnerability Management**

Continuously identify, classify, remediate, and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities might also be introduced with changes to existing systems or with addition of new systems. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities to help protect against new threats. Employ vulnerability scanners and endpoint agents to associate systems with known vulnerabilities. Prioritize remediation actions based on the vulnerability risk. Apply remediation actions, and report to relevant stakeholders. Leverage red teaming and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in your system architecture; seek prior authorization from your cloud provider as required.

6. **Operations Perspective Capabilities**

The Operations Perspective comprises nine capabilities including Observability, Event Management (AIOps), Incident and Problem Management, Change and Release Management, Performance and Capacity Management, Configuration Management, Patch Management, Availability and Continuity Management, and Application Management. To learn more about some of these capabilities, expand the following three categories.

- **Observability**

Gain actionable insights from your infrastructure and application data.

When you are operating at cloud speed and scale, you need to be able to spot problems as they arise, ideally before they disrupt the customer experience. Develop the telemetry(logs, metrics, and traces) necessary to understand the internal state and health of your workloads. Monitor application endpoints, assess the impact to the end users, and generate alerts when measurements exceed thresholds.

Use synthetic monitoring to create canaries (configurable scripts that run on a schedule) to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Implement traces to track requests as they travel through the entire application, and identify bottlenecks or performance issues. Gain insights into resources, servers, databases, and networks using metrics and logs. Set up real-time analysis of time series data to understand causes of performance impacts. Centralize data in a single dashboard, giving you a unified view of critical information about your workloads and their performance.

- **Event Management (AIOps)**

Detect events, assess their potential impact, and determine the appropriate control action.

Being able to filter the noise, focus on priority events, predict impending resource exhaustion, automatically generate alerts and incidents, and identify likely causes and remediation actions will help you improve incident detection and response times. Establish an event store pattern and take advantage of ML, specifically, artificial intelligence operations (AIOps), to automate event correlation, anomaly detection, and causality determination. Integrate with cloud services and third-party tools, including with your incident management system and process. Automate responses to events to reduce errors caused by manual processes and ensure prompt and consistent responses.

- **Additional Capabilities**
    - Incident and Problem Management – Quickly restore service operations and minimize adverse business impact.
    - Change and Release Management – Introduce and modify workloads while minimizing the risk to production environments.
    - Performance and Capacity – Monitor workload performance and ensure that capacity meets current and future demands. 
    - Configuration Management – Maintain a record of cloud workloads, their relationships, and configuration changes over time.
    - Patch Management – Systematically distribute and apply software updates.
    - Availability and Continuity Management – Ensure availability of business-critical information, applications, and services. 
    - Application Management – Investigate and remediate application issues in a single pane of glass.
