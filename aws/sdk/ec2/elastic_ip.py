"""Using Elastic IP addresses in Amazon EC2

The scenario
An Elastic IP address is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing. 
An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. It is a public IP address, 
which is reachable from the Internet. If your instance does not have a public IP address, 
you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the Internet.

In this example, Python code performs several Amazon EC2 operations involving Elastic IP addresses. 
The code uses the AWS SDK for Python to manage IAM access keys using these methods of the EC2 client class:

- describe_addresses.
- allocate_address.
- release_address.
