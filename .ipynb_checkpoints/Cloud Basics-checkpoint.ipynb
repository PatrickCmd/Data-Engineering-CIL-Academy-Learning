    "\n",
    "**Cloud Computing** refers to the delivery of on-demand computing resources and services over the internet servers, storage, databases, software, analytics, and networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the internet. A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Six advantages of cloud computing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade fixed expense for variable expense** – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.\n",
    "- **Benefit from massive economies of scale** – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.\n",
    "- **Stop guessing capacity** – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.\n",
    "- **Increase speed and agility** – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.\n",
    "- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers** – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.\n",
    "- **Go global in minutes** – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of cloud computing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud computing models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**\n",
    "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**\n",
    "Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software as a Service (SaaS)**\n",
    "Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud computing deployment models\n",
    "**Cloud**\n",
    "A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or can use higher level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid**\n",
    "A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to the internal system. For more information on how AWS can help you with your hybrid deployment, visit our Hybrid Cloud with AWS page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On-premises**\n",
    "The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called the “private cloud.” On-premises deployment doesn’t provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization. For more information on how AWS can help, refer to Use case: Cloud services on-premises.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global infrastructure\n",
    "he AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. \n",
    "- **An AWS Region** is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones. \n",
    "- **Availability Zones** consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. \n",
    "These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. For the latest information on the AWS Cloud Availability Zones and AWS Regions, refer to [AWS Global Infrastructure](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security and compliance\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "**Cloud security** at AWS is the highest priority. As organizations embrace the scalability and flexibility of the cloud, AWS is helping them evolve security, identity, and compliance into key business enablers. AWS builds security into the core of our cloud infrastructure, and offers foundational services to help organizations meet their unique security requirements in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An advantage of the AWS Cloud is that it allows you to scale and innovate, while maintaining a secure environment and paying only for the services you use. This means that you can have the security you need at a lower cost than in an on-premises environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an AWS customer you inherit all the best practices of AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes built to satisfy the requirements of our most security-sensitive customers. Get the flexibility and agility you need in security controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Cloud enables a shared responsibility model. While AWS manages security of the cloud, you are responsible for security in the cloud. This means that you retain control of the security you choose to implement to protect your own content, platform, applications, systems, and networks no differently than you would in an on-site data center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of AWS security\n",
    "- **Keep Your data safe** — The AWS infrastructure puts strong safeguards in place to help protect your privacy. All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Meet compliance requirements** — AWS manages dozens of compliance programs in its infrastructure. This means that segments of your compliance have already been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Save money**: —Cut costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale quickly** — Security scales with your AWS Cloud usage. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compliance\n",
    "**AWS Cloud Complianc**e helps you understand the robust controls in place at AWS for security and data protection in the cloud. Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer, and you can visit the [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) to learn more. Customers can feel confident in operating and building on top of the security controls AWS uses on its infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IT infrastructure that AWS provides to its customers is designed and managed in alignment with best security practices and a variety of IT security standards. The following is a partial list of assurance programs with which AWS complies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP\n",
    "\n",
    "- PCI DSS Level 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amazon Web Services Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS consists of many cloud services that you can use in combinations tailored to your business or organizational needs. This section introduces the major AWS services by category. To access the services, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or Software Development Kits (SDKs).\n",
