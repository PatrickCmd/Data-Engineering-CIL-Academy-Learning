    "- The **internet** is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected devices. It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) [5].\n",
    "- TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter which device you’re using or where you’re using it.\n",
    "- When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.\n",
    "- When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.\n",
    "    - **Internet Protocol(IP)** is a system of rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another computer over an internet connection.\n",
    "- Using a numerical address (IP Address) the IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred.\n",
    "- The Transport Control Protocol (TCP) works with IP to ensure transfer of data is dependable and reliable. This helps to make sure that no packets are lost, packets are reassembled in proper sequence, and there’s no delay negatively affecting the data quality.\n",

    "### WHEN YOU TYPE IN A WEB ADDRESS INTO YOUR BROWSER...\n",
    "**Step 1**: Your PC or device is connected to the web through a modem or router. Together, these devices allow you to connect to other networks around the globe [6].\n",
    "Your router enables multiple computers to join the same network while a modem connects to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) which provides you with either cable or DSL internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Type in a web address, known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Each website has its own unique URL that signals to your ISP where you want to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Your query is pushed to your ISP which connects to several servers which store and send data like a NAP Server (Network Access Protection) and a DNS (Domain Name Server).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, your browser looks up the IP address for the domain name you typed into your search engine through DNS. DNS then translates the text-based domain name you type into the browser into the number-based IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: Google.com becomes 64.233.191.255\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Your browser sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to the target server to send a copy of the website to the client using TCP/IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5**: The server then approves request and sends a “200 OK” message to your computer. Then, the server sends website files to the browser in the form of data packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6**: As your browser reassembles the data packets, the website loads allowing you to learn, shop, browse, and engage.\n",

    "## A brief history of the internet\n",
    "Philosophers and authors have conceptualized a shared repository of world knowledge for centuries. How did we get to the internet we know today?\n",
    "\n",
    "MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **October 29, 1969**: ARPANET (later renamed internet) created a successful connection between University of California Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute.\n",
    "- **Late 1960s**: Libraries automate and network catalogs independent of ARPANET.\n",
    "- **1970s**: Transport Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is established, allowing for internet technology to mature. The invention of these protocols helped to standardize how information was sent and received over the web.\n",
    "- **1986**: National Science Foundation funded NSFNET, which is the 56 Kbps backbone of the internet. There were commercial restrictions in place at this time because federal funds were being used to run and maintain it.\n",
    "- **1991**: User-friendly internet interface was created.\n",
    "- **July 1992**: Delphi became the first national commercial online service to offer internet access.\n",
    "- **May 1995**: All commercial use limitations on the internet disappear. This allowed the internet to diversify and grow rapidly.\n",
    "- **1997**: WiFi was invented.\n",
    "- **1998**: Windows 98 hit the market.\n",
    "- **2007**: Widespread smartphone adoption.\n",
    "- **2009**: 4G network is introduced.\n",
    "- **Today**: 3 billion people use the internet. [3]\n",
    "- **2030**: 7.5 billion projected internet users and 500 billion devices connected to the internet. [4]\n",
