    "### Linux Shells\n",
    "\n",
    "- A shell is an environment in which we run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes, it displays the program's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of shells\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bourne shell (sh)\n",
    "- Korn shell (ksh)\n",
    "- Bourne again shell (bash)\n",
    "- POSIX shell (sh)\n",
    "- C shell (csh)\n",
    "- TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands, which are listed in the order of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### .The shebang\n",
    "\n",
    "`#!/bin/sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "- This tells the system that the commands that follow are to be executed by the Bourne shell. It's called a `shebang` because the `#` symbol is called a `hash` and `!` symbol is called a `bang`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An example of Shell Script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shell Script comments\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "# Author: Patrick Walukagga\n",
    "# Copyright: @patrickcmd\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Executing a shell script\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to execute a shell script you will have to assign the script file an executable permission by using any of the following commands\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "chmod +x script_name.sh\n",
    "chmod 755 script_name.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To run the shell script you have to invoke the shell in any of the below ways\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "bash script_name.sh\n",
    "sh script_name.sh\n",
    "./script_name.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a shell script to get the current date and time, the present working directory and also list the contents of the `/var` directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "# Author: Patrick Walukagga\n",
    "# Copyright: @patrickcmd\n",
    "echo \"-----------------\"\n",
    "date\n",
    "echo \"-----------------\"\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "echo \"-----------------\"\n",
    "ls -l /var\n",
    "echo \"-----------------\"\n",
    "exit 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assigning Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can assign variables as in any programming languages. Their values are always stored as strings, but there are mathematical operators in the shell language that will convert variables to numbers for calculations.\n",
    "- We have no need to declare variables, just assigning a value to its reference will create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "# Author: Patrick Walukagga\n",
    "# Copyright: @patrickcmd\n",
    "STR=\"Hello World!\"\n",
    "echo $STR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Variables from user input\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `read` command allows you to prompt for input and store it in a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example to create two files and delete one of them**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "touch file1 file2\n",
    "echo -n \"Enter name of file to delete: \"\n",
    "read file\n",
    "echo \"Type 'y' to remove it, 'n' to change your mind...\"\n",
    "rm -i $file\n",
    "echo \"That was YOUR decision\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "- The backquote \" \\` \" is different from the single quote \" \\' \". It is used for command substitution: \\`command\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#!/bin/sh\n",
    "LIST=`ls`\n",
    "DATE=`date`\n",
    "echo \"Today's date is $DATE.\"\n",
    "echo \"The list of files is:\\n$LIST\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arithmetic Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `let` statement can be used to do mathematical functions\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#! /bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "let X=10+2*7\n",
    "let Y=X+2*4\n",
    "echo \"X is $X\"\n",
    "echo \"Y is $Y\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- An arithmetic expression can be evaluated by `$[expression]` or `$((expression))`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#! /bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "P=\"$((123+20))\"\n",
    "echo \"Answer of P is: $P\"\n",
    "\n",
    "VALUE=$[123+20]\n",
    "echo \"Value is: $VALUE\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Shell Script Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Write a Shell Script to obtain the user's name and his age from input and print the year when the user would become 50 years of age**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#! /bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "read -p \"Enter your name: \" NAME\n",
    "echo \"Your name is $NAME\"\n",

    "echo \"You will be 50 years old in $YEAR_TO_BE_FIFTY\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Write a Shell Script to create a directory called `test00` inside `/tmp` and three blank files `file01`, `file02`, `file03` inside it and list them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "#! /bin/bash\n",

    "echo -e \"Files in /tmp/test00 are: \\n$LIST\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Write a Shell Script to delete the file `file03` in the question 2 above and also print the time after the deletion of the file**\n",

    "### Loops in Shell Script\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loops are powerful programming tool that enable you to execute a set of commands. The following types of loops are available for programmers;\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The **while loop**\n",
