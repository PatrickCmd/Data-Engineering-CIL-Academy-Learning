    "The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requirement analysis\n",
    "- Planning\n",
    "- Software design such as architectural design\n",
    "- Software development\n",
    "- Testing\n",
    "- Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the software development life cycle?\n",
    "\n",
    "SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SDLC involves six phases as explained in the introduction. Popular SDLC models include the **waterfall model**, **spiral model**, and **Agile model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "![SDLC stages](https://stackify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SDLC-HS2020.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stages and Best Practices\n",
    "Following the best practices and/or stages of SDLC ensures the process works in a smooth, efficient, and productive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Current Problems** \n",
    "“What are the current problems?” This stage of the SDLC means getting input from all stakeholders, including customers, salespeople, industry experts, and programmers. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of the current system with improvement as the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Plan**\n",
    "“What do we want?” In this stage of the SDLC, the team determines the cost and resources required for implementing the analyzed requirements. It also details the risks involved and provides sub-plans for softening those risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the team should determine the feasibility of the project and how they can implement the project successfully with the lowest risk in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Design**\n",
    "“How will we get what we want?” This phase of the SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions. It’s crucial to have a plan for collecting and incorporating stakeholder input into this document. Failure at this stage will almost certainly result in cost overruns at best and the total collapse of the project at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build**\n",
    "“Let’s create what we want.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the actual development starts. It’s important that every developer sticks to the agreed blueprint. Also, make sure you have proper guidelines in place about the code style and practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, define a nomenclature for files or define a variable naming style such as camelCase. This will help your team to produce organized and consistent code that is easier to understand but also to test during the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Test**\n",
    "“Did we get what we want?” In this stage, we test for defects and deficiencies. We fix those issues until the product meets the original specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we want to verify if the code meets the defined requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try Stackify’s free code profiler, Prefix, to write better code on your workstation. Prefix works with .NET, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Software Deployment**\n",
    "“Let’s start using what we got.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the goal is to deploy the software to the production environment so users can start using the product. However, many organizations choose to move the product through different deployment environments such as a testing or staging environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows any stakeholders to safely play with the product before releasing it to the market. Besides, this allows any final mistakes to be caught before releasing the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Scrum\n",
    "Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Scrum Works\n",
    "In a rugby scrum, all the players literally put their heads together. When it comes to software development, a scrum can be characterized by developers putting their heads together to address complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features — a.k.a. **a product backlog**. The team meets to discuss:\n",
    "    - The backlog.\n",
    "    - What still needs to be completed.\n",
    "    - How long it will take.\n",
    "- Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints:\n",
    "    - Sprints are periods of time when software development is actually done.\n",
    "    - A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the backlog.\n",
    "    - The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product.\n",
    "    - Each sprint ends with a sprint review.\n",
    "    - Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop — which starts a new sprint.\n",
    "    - Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.\n",
    "- In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and make plans for that day.\n",
    "    - The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes.\n",
    "    - Each team member needs to be present and prepared.\n",
    "    - The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scrum Process](https://stackify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Scrum_Framework.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is in the Scrum?\n",
    "In rugby, the forwards are involved in the scrum. In software development, three roles are defined in the scrum framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **scrum team** does the work. It is the individuals who are working together in the sprints to produce the products.\n",
    "- The **scrum master** is part of the scrum team makes sure the team works in compliance with the scrum rules. This is not a manager.\n",
    "- The **product owner** represents the customer. This role prioritizes the backlog and coordinates the scrum teamwork. The product owner is a role similar to project manager in more traditional project management frameworks."
