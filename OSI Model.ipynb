    "# THE OSI MODEL\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ISO**: - International Organization for Standardization\n",
    "- **IEC**: - International Electrotechnical Commission\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this Reference Model of **Open Systems Interconnection** is to provide a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection, while allowing existing standards to be placed into perspective within the overall Reference Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The term **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)** qualifies standards for the exchange of information among systems that are “open” to one another for this purpose by virtue of their mutual use of the applicable standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooperation among open systems involves a broad range of activities of which the following have been identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a) interprocess communication, which concerns the exchange of information and the synchronization of activity between OSI application processes;\n",
    "- b) data representation, which concerns all aspects of the creation and maintenance of data descriptions and data transformations for reformatting data exchanged between open systems;\n",
    "- c) data storage, which concerns storage media, and file and database systems for managing and providing access to data stored on the media;\n",
    "- d) process and resource management, which concerns the means by which OSI application processes are declared, initiated and controlled, and the means by which they acquire OSI resources;\n",
    "- e) integrity and security, which concern information processing constraints that have to be preserved or assured during the operation of the open systems; and\n",
    "- f) program support, which concerns the definition, compilation, linking, testing, storage, transfer, and access to the programs executed by OSI application-processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Open System Interconnection model (OSI)** is a seven layer model used to visualize computer networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each of the seven layers goes up in increments of one as it gets closer to the human user. Layer one — the application layer, is closest to the person while layer seven — the physical layer is where the network receives and transmits raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The OSI model belongs to the **International Organization for Standards (ISO)** and is maintained by the identification **ISO/IEC 7498–1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Protocol: \n",
    "A protocol is the set of rules or algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network and there exists different protocol defined at each layer of the OSI model. Few of such protocols are TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, DHCP, FTP and so on. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Layer 7 — Application\n",
    "The application layer is where the user inputs data and data is output to the user. The application layer is usually software that is run off the local machine, however this depends on the network architecture. The software could be cloud based, meaning it runs off a server in a remote location and data is transferred over the internet, or the software could be run on a local server. The application layer provides services for email, Telnet and file Transfer for example. An example of the application layer is an internet browser, an FTP client or even Microsoft Word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application layer identifies communication components, determines resource availability, and ensures that communication runs smoothly. This layer is what allows access to network resources, so you'll likely recognize its most common protocols:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\n",
    "- Telnet\n",
    "- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)\n",
    "- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer 6 — Presentation\n",
    "The presentation layer is where the operating system lies. This operating system could be Windows, OS X, a Unix based operating system or one of the many others available. Where the human user interacts with the application layer described above, the application layer interacts with the presentation layer. This may be done directly, or through a runtime environment such as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer 5 — Session\n",
    "The session layer is responsible for creating and maintaining sessions between the operating system on the presentation layer and other, third party machines. For example, when a user is browsing the internet, they are interacting with the application layer, the application layer is interacting with the presentation layer and the session layer allows the operating system to interact with the web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer 4 — Transport\n",
    "The transport layer is responsible for the logistics of the session. In the example used above, the transport layer would be responsible for determining what and how much information is transferred between the operating system and the web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer 3 — Network\n",
    "The network layer is where routers operate. A router is a hardware device that forwards packets of information between computers on a network. This is where your IP address comes from and in the example used above, the router is responsible for sending packets of information out into the internet and receiving them. These packets origin and destination is determined by the IP address of your router.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer 2 — Data link\n",
    "The data link layer is where switches operate and provides a reliable link between two directly connected nodes. The data link layer is also responsible for detecting and possibly fixing any packet errors that may form on the physical layer. The data link layer is divided into two separate layers, the **Media Access Control (MAC)** and **Logical Link Control (LLC)** layers. The MAC layer is responsible for controlling how devices connected to the network gain access. The LLC layer controls error checking, possible fixes and packet synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer 1 — Physical\n",
    "The physical layer is literally the physical hardware that makes up the network. This layer has several major functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining physical specifications\n",
    "- Defining protocols\n",
    "- Defining transmission mode (half duplex & full duplex)\n",
    "- Defining the network’s topology\n",
    "Hardware such as the physical components of Ethernet cables and Bluetooth are just some examples of the physical layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of the OSI Model\n",
    "Even after reading a description of each of the seven layers, you may still be confused as to how the OSI model applies to real life networking. It’s commonly misunderstood how a model can be used to solve real-life problems and in some cases, a model may not be the best approach. However, in many aspects of Information & Communications Technology(ICT), a model can be extremely useful and that is the case for the OSI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When first discovering a networking problem, it can be confusing as to where you should start. The OSI model helps you to start figuring out where the problem may reside and therefore, help you to solve the problem. For example, a client’s computer is not able to reach a website. The problem is isolated to one device on the network, so it can be assumed that the problem is likely to be on the application layer. However, after testing you find that the problem still exists when you try a different web browser and so the application layer is ruled out. You then assume that the problem resides on the presentation layer and start looking for faulty settings. After some digging around you find that your client has entered some DNS settings incorrectly and so you then conclude the problem is on the presentation layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already be using the OSI model for simple problem solving such as the example above without even realizing it. However, when dealing with large, corporate scale networking a purposeful use of the OSI model can make your job much easier and more enjoyable.\n",

    "## Internet protocol suite\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Internet protocol suite**, commonly known as **TCP/IP**, is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The foundational protocols in the suite are the \n",
    "   - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), \n",
    "   - the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), \n",
    "   - and the Internet Protocol (IP). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers of the Internet protocol suite\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking. An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a **protocol stack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From lowest to highest, the layers are the;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **link layer**, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link)\n",
    "- **the internet layer**, providing internetworking between independent networks\n",
    "- **the transport layer**, handling host-to-host communication\n",
    "- **the application layer**, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **technical standards** underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**. The Internet protocol suite predates the **OSI model**, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internet Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Internet Protocol (IP)** is the network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying **datagrams** across network boundaries. Its **routing** function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A **datagram** is a basic transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network. Datagrams are typically structured in header and payload sections. Datagrams provide a connectionless communication service across a packet-switched network. The delivery, arrival time, and order of arrival of datagrams need not be guaranteed by the network.\n",
    "    - **Routing** is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), and computer networks, such as the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- IP has the task of delivering **packets** from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In telecommunications and computer networking, a **network packet** is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data; the latter is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, or sequencing information). Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers.\n",
    "    - A **network host** is a computer or other device connected to a computer network. A host may work as a server offering information resources, services, and applications to users or other hosts on the network. Hosts are assigned at least one network address.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A computer participating in networks that use the Internet protocol suite may also be called an **IP host**. Specifically, computers participating in the Internet are called **Internet hosts**. Internet hosts and other IP hosts have one or more IP addresses assigned to their network interfaces. The addresses are configured either manually by an administrator, automatically at startup by means of the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, or by stateless address autoconfiguration methods.\n",
    "    - In information technology, **header** refers to supplemental data placed at the beginning of a block of data being stored or transmitted. In data transmission, the data following the header is sometimes called the **payload** or **body**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first major version of IP, **Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)**, is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is **Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)**, which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since c. 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.[2] For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each datagram has two components: a **header** and a **payload**. \n",
    "    - The IP header includes source IP address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram. \n",
    "    - The payload is the data that is transported. This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- IP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into subnetworks, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries. Routers communicate with one another via specially designed routing protocols, either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols, as needed for the topology of the network.\n",

    "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QGgEk20RXM\n",
    "- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-application-layer-protocols-in-tcp-ip\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the **Internet Protocol (IP)**. Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as **TCP/IP**. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the `World Wide Web`, `email`, `remote administration`, and `file transfer` rely on TCP, which is part of the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP suite. `SSL/TLS` often runs on top of TCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TCP is **connection-oriented**, and a connection between client and server is established before data can be sent. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established. \n",
    "    - Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency. \n",
    "    - Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. \n",
    "    - TCP employs network congestion avoidance. However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### User Datagram Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is one of the core communication protocols of the Internet protocol suite used to send messages (transported as datagrams in packets) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. \n",
    "- UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use -- UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP is a simple message-oriented transport layer protocol that is documented in RFC 768. Although UDP provides integrity verification (via checksum) of the header and payload,[2] it provides no guarantees to the upper layer protocol for message delivery and the UDP layer retains no state of UDP messages once sent. For this reason, UDP sometimes is referred to as Unreliable Datagram Protocol.[3] If transmission reliability is desired, it must be implemented in the user's application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of UDP's attributes make it especially suited for certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query-response protocols such as the Domain Name System or the Network Time Protocol.\n",
    "- It provides datagrams, suitable for modeling other protocols such as IP tunneling or remote procedure call and the Network File System.\n",
    "- It is simple, suitable for bootstrapping or other purposes without a full protocol stack, such as the DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol.\n",
    "- It is stateless, suitable for very large numbers of clients, such as in streaming media applications such as IPTV.\n",
    "- The lack of retransmission delays makes it suitable for real-time applications such as Voice over IP, online games, and many protocols using Real Time Streaming Protocol.\n",
    "- Because it supports multicast, it is suitable for broadcast information such as in many kinds of service discovery and shared information such as Precision Time Protocol and Routing Information Protocol."

    "\n",
    "#### In a one page document, compare the OSI model to any day to day layered process you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The OSI model, or Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework used to describe how data communication occurs between different computer systems. It is composed of seven layers, each of which represents a different stage in the communication process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the OSI model to a day-to-day layered process, let's consider the process of making a sandwich. This may seem like a simple task, but like the OSI model, it involves multiple layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sandwich** is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 1**: Physical Layer - The first layer of the OSI model deals with the physical aspects of communication, such as cables and connectors. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would include the physical items needed to make a sandwich, such as bread, meat, cheese, and vegetables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 2**: Data Link Layer - The second layer of the OSI model ensures that data is transmitted without errors. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would involve checking that all the ingredients are fresh and not expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 3**: Network Layer - The third layer of the OSI model is responsible for routing data between different networks. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would involve deciding which type of sandwich to make and which ingredients to use depending on the order by a given client or customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 4**: Transport Layer - The fourth layer of the OSI model deals with the transport of data between devices. The transport layer would be responsible for determining what and how much information is transferred between presentation and application layer, for example the operating system and the web server in this case. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would involve assembling the sandwich in a particular order, such as bread, meat, cheese, and vegetables and how much quantity of all the ingredients to add in the sandwich, then serving it to the client who orderd it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 5**: Session Layer - The fifth layer of the OSI model establishes and manages connections between devices. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would involve deciding who will eat the sandwich and where it will be eaten. Is it a take away or is to be delivered to clients destination or is the person to take sandwich from the place of ordering for example restaurant cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 6**: Presentation Layer - The sixth layer of the OSI model ensures that data is presented in a format that can be understood by both the sender and the receiver. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would involve presenting the sandwich in an attractive and appetizing way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 7**: Application Layer - The seventh and final layer of the OSI model deals with the specific applications that are being used to communicate. In the sandwich-making process, this layer would involve selecting the type of sandwich that is desired and any additional condiments (salt, chili or any other flavors) or toppings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, just like the OSI model, many everyday processes involve multiple layers of abstraction and complexity. By breaking down these processes into individual layers, it becomes easier to understand and manage them effectively."
