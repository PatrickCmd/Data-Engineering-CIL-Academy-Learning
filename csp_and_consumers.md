# Cloud Service Providers and Consumers

Cloud service providers and consumers are two essential players in the cloud computing ecosystem.

- **A cloud service provider (CSP)** is a company that provides cloud-based services and resources, such as computing power, storage, and applications, to businesses and individuals. CSPs can include large technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as smaller, specialized providers.

- **Cloud consumers**, on the other hand, are the customers who use the services and resources provided by the CSPs. They may be businesses or individuals who use the cloud for a wide range of purposes, such as hosting websites, running applications, storing and processing data, or collaborating on projects.
