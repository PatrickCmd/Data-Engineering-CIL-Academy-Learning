# Cloud Service Providers and Consumers

Cloud service providers and consumers are two essential players in the cloud computing ecosystem.

- **A cloud service provider (CSP)** is a company that provides cloud-based services and resources, such as computing power, storage, and applications, to businesses and individuals. CSPs can include large technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as smaller, specialized providers.

- **Cloud consumers**, on the other hand, are the customers who use the services and resources provided by the CSPs. They may be businesses or individuals who use the cloud for a wide range of purposes, such as hosting websites, running applications, storing and processing data, or collaborating on projects.

        - Amazon RDS is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.
        - Managed means you still have the power to decide how the database will be launched, but Amazon RDS will launch it for you. You can set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks. Amazon RDS is compatible with multiple engines, and you can use it to launch the Amazon Aurora database. 
        - Choose from seven popular engines: Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility, Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

### Networking
- [Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)
    - Amazon VPC is your private network space you create to launch your resources in the AWS Cloud.
    - More than one VPC can be launched into your AWS accounts.
    - A private network that provides logical isolation for your workloads
        - This private network is logically isolated from other VPC or remote networks; for example, isolating development from testing.
        - You can control the traffic that can flow in and out of Amazon VPC and the resources launched within.
        - You can also control how to connect your VPC with other networks.
    - Custom access controls and security settings for your resource
        - You can use different VPCs to launch different workloads or stages or workloads if you want to benefit from such logical isolation.
        - You configure how the packets travel through the layers of your network.

- [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) is a highly available and scalable cloud DNS service.

    - [Route 53 routing traffic to an ELB load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-elb-load-balancer.html)
    - Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is the load balancing service. 
    - Elastic Load Balancing is a web service that improves an application's availability by distributing incoming traffic between two or more EC2 instances. 
    - ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).
    - It also serves as a single point of contact with your application. 
    - As a result, your end users do not need to be aware of how many machines your application is running on or all the details, such as the IP addresses of those machines.

### Security
- [The shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
    - This model describes specifically what the customers and AWS are responsible for maintaining. It is also important to get used to terminology used in the Shared Responsibility Model. Review the customer responsibilities and AWS responsibilities.
    - **AWS responsibility "Security of the Cloud"**: AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and all of the physical and environmental controls that run AWS Cloud services.
        - AWS software
            - Compute, Storage, Databases, Networking
        - Hardware and AWS Global Infrastructure
            - Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations
    - **Customer responsibility "Security in the Cloud"**: Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects.

        - **AWS Artifact**: Use the AWS Artifact service to generate on-demand compliance reports.
        - **AWS KMS**: AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) helps you generate, manage, and rotate your encryption keys. You can also control who has access to those keys.
        - **AWS Shield**: Shield protects you from common distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
- [AWS Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/)
    - AWS Trusted Advisor guides you on how to reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security.
    - AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices. 
    - Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks. 
    - These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. You can then follow the recommendations to optimize your services and resources.
    - Trusted Advisor analyzes your environments across five dimensions: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. 

### Pricing
- AWS pricing concepts
    - Pay for what you use
    - Pay less when you reserve.

- On-Demand Instances
    - Charged per hour/second
    - Short-term
    - Unpredictable workloads

- Reserved Instances/Savings Plans
    - Discount for 1- to 3-year commitments
    - Larger upfront payment for a greater discount
    - When you purchase a Reserved Instance, you can choose between a **Standard Reserved Instance** or a **Convertible Reserved Instance** offering class. Both options are one-year to three-year terms.
        - **Standard Reserved Instance**: enables you to modify the Availability Zone, scope, networking type, and instance size (within the same instance type) of your Reserved Instance. 
        - **Convertible Reserved Instance**: Enables you to exchange one or more Convertible Reserved Instances for another Convertible Reserved Instance with a different configuration, including instance family, operating system, and tenancy.           
    - There are no limits to how often you perform an exchange as long as the target Convertible Reserved Instance is of an equal or higher value than the Convertible Reserved Instances you are exchanging.

- Spot Instances
    - Up to 90 percent discount
    - Applications with flexible start and end times
    - Urgent computing needs for large amounts of capacity
- Dedicated Hosts – Pay for a physical host that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to reduce costs.
- Dedicated Instances – Pay, by the hour, for instances that run on single-tenant hardware.
- Capacity Reservations – Reserve capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.
