## Technical Design Document
A Technical Design Document in simple terms is a description of the requirements, use cases, solutions, functionality, architecture, operations, etc, of a technical system, product or service.

Other names for Technical Design Documents include:
- Technical Specifications
- Systems Design Document

A Technical Design Document can be:
- High Level
- Low Level (aka detailed design)
- Mixed (both high and low)

## High and Low Level Design Documents
- High Level designs cover business/commercial aspects (overview, purpose, why, etc)
- A high level designs provides a broad view without going into technical details.
- A Low Level design provides the (technical) details that were not covered in the HLD
- If the design goes beyond business level(e.g, to explain a solution in technical terms), it is low level design.
- If it has technical details that need explaining to a lay person, it is definitely a low level design.
- You can create a mixed design by specifying the high level sections at the top and the more detailed design as the document progresses.
