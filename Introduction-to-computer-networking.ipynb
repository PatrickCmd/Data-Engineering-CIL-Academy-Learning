    "\n",
    "- A computer network is defined as a system that connects two or more computing devices connected by media for transmitting and sharing information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer network consists of: Two or more devices connected by media with apps to support information sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "- We call the interconnection of computers, a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Internet is just an interconnection of computers around the world, like a giant spider web that brings all of us together. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Network protocols are a set of rules for how we transfer data in a network. There are rules that make sure our packets are routed efficiently, aren’t corrupted, are secure, go to the right machine, and are named appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Internet Protocol or IP, is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers. The Internet Protocol helps us route information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Transmission Control Protocol or TCP, is a protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. This protocol was an important part of the creation of the internet since it let us share information with other computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Blocks of networks\n",
    "- Devices (Computers, Servers, Printers, Disk Drives etc)\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Internet Protocol(IP) address**: Is a logical address to identify or locate a specific machine/device on a local area network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Switch**: Is a device that sits within the local area network range that helps with the communication among the different nodes on the networrk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A router** is a networking device that forwards data packets between \"DIFFERENT\" computer computers. A network device that sits between a local area network and the outside network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GATEWAY** - The IP address of the router.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subnet** defines your local area network range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: is a method of remapping an IP address while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Firewall**: A set of passive rules to protect the network from unauthorized access to enable a standard communication between the internal and external newtorks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demilitarized zone (DMZ)**: is a subnetwork that contains and exposes a DEVICE to an untrusted network such as the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Port forwarding**: redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall.\n",

    "- **Subnet** defines your local area network range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subnetting** is the practice of dividing a network into two or more networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A subnet mask** is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses. The `255` address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the `0` address is always assigned to a network address.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **A subnet mask** is defined as a 32-bit address that segregates an IP address into network bits that identify the network and host bits that identify the host device operating on that network.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - A **class A** network would have a subnet mask of `255.0.0.0` which means that **8 bits** are used for the network. In CIDR notation this is designated by a `/8` following the IP address\n",

    "    - A **class B** network would have a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0` which means that **16 bits** are used for the network. In CIDR notation this is designated by a `/16` following the IP address\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "    - Subnetting is always done from left to right.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **CLASSLESS INTER DOMAIN ROUTING (CIDR) or supernetting**: is a method of assigning IP addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on `Class A`, `Class B` and `Class C` networks.

For example, `192.168.129.23/17` indicates a `17-bit` network mask. Internet users can refer to a `/17` network to indicate the network's size without specifying an actual network mask.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - **Broadcast ID**: This address is used to transmit data to all of the hosts on the local subnet. The broadcast address is used by multiple protocols such as `ARP`, the `Routing Information Protocol (RIP)`, and other protocols that must transmit data before they know the local subnet mask.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - An IP broadcast address is the highest number in its class; for example, the broadcast address of a **Class C** `192.168.16.0` network is `192.168.16.255`.\n",
