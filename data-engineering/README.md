# Introduction to Data Engineering: Concepts, Roles, Processes, and Tools

### What is data engineering?
**Data engineering** is a set of operations to make data available and usable to data scientists, data analysts, business intelligence (BI) developers, and other specialists within an organization. It takes dedicated experts – data engineers – to design and build systems for gathering and storing data at scale as well as preparing it for further analysis.

## Breaking Free from legacy databases
### Why break free?
**Which of these cloud-native database benefits are most important to you?**
- Improve performance and scalability
- Reduce database operations burden
- Avoid annual contracts and unexpected costs

> A growing list of AWS customers are embracing cloud-native databases because they are optimized for microservices-based architectures and the large-scale environment of the internet.

### Factors to consider when migrating to a cloud-native database
- Database type (Relational SQL, NoSQL Databases)

In recent years, NoSQL databases have challenged the dominance of the traditional relational database. NoSQL databases, such as **Amazon DynamoDB**, offer a different set of features and performance characteristics, such as ways to split or shard data across an infinite number of physical machines to allow for seamless scaling.

If you don’t have the resources to completely rearchitect your data model or have special use cases that require strong consistency, **Amazon Aurora** can be a great option. Aurora is a cloud-native relational database that offers compatibility with MySQL and PostgreSQL. It has a purpose-built storage engine to take full advantage of the cloud.

- Database migration options
    - AWS provides a number of options to help ensure that your data migration is handled correctly and with minimal downtime.
        - AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)
        - AWs Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT)
        - AWS Database Freedom Program
        - Amazon Database Migration Accelerator Solution
        - AWS Professional Services
        - AWS Partners
    - **AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)** is a self-service option for migrating databases. You can use AWS DMS to migrate between homogeneous database types, such as going from one MySQL instance to a new MySQL instance. You can also use AWS DMS between heterogeneous database types, such as moving from a commercial database like Oracle to a cloud-native relational database like Aurora. Use the **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT)** to help migrate your database schema between heterogeneous database types.

    - The **AWS Database Freedom Program** provides expert advice and migration assistance to qualified customers. If you need hands-on assistance, the **AWS Professional Services** team is available to help with your migration. Finally, there are a number of **AWS Partners** who can help with your migration.
